        <h3>Recipe</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare vegetables.
                Dice onion, about 0.5cm square.
            </li>
            <li>Cut 1 red pepper in half lengthways, 
                remove stalk and wash the seeds away,
                then chop. Peel and finely chop two 
                garlic cloves.
            </li>
            <li>Start cooking. Put your pan on the hob
                over a medium heat. Add 1tbsp oil and 
                leave for 1-2min until hot.
            </li>
            <li>Add the onion and cook, stirring fairly
                frequently, for about 5 min, until the
                onion is soft, squidgy and slightly
                translucent.
            </li>
            <li>Tip in the garlic, red pepper, 1 heaped 
                tsp hot chilli powder, 1 tsp paprika and
                1 tsp ground cumin.
            </li>
            <li>Give it a good stir, then leave it to cook
                for another 5 min, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Brown 500g mince. Turn up the heat on the veg
                pan, and add the mince, breaking it up as you 
                do so.
            </li>
            <li>Keep stirring and prodding for at least 5 min 
                until the mince is uniformly spread and there
                are no pink bits. Make sure you keep the heat
                hot enough for the meat to fry and brown, 
                rather than simply stewing.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the stock and add to the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Add tomatoes, marjoram, (sugar if not using 
                chocolate,) salt and pepper. Squirt
                in about 2 tbsp pure&eacute; and stir the sauce
                well.
            </li>
            <li>Simmer gently. Bring the whole thing to the boil,
                give it a good stir and cover the pan. Leave 
                gently bubbling for 20 mins.
            </li>
            <li>Check the pan occasionally to stir and make sure
                the saue isn't boiling dry. If so, add a couple 
                tbsp water and make sure the heat is low enough.
            </li>
            <li>Drain and rinse kidney beans and stir into chilli 
                pot, along with chocolate. Bring to boil again,
                and simmer for 10 min, adding water if it looks dry.
            </li>
            <li>Taste and season. Will probably require more 
                seasoning than expected.
            </li>
            <li>Once ready, leave to stand for 10 min to allow 
                flavours to mingle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Server on a bed of rice with sour cream on top. 
                Alternately, pile it on tortilla chips and sprinkle
                with grated cheddar. Or, wrap in a tortilla with 
                shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes and guacamole for
                a burrito.
            </li>
