<!-- THIS FILE IS BEING USED TO LEARN TO WRITE A COMMIT MESSAGE -->

<!-- Commit is composed to two parts - subject and body. -->
<!-- Subject: Brief summary -->
<!-- Body: Describe problem and how it fixes -->

<!-- Commit messages best read into file and then written out to commit
    using --file option -->
<!-- RULES: -->
<!-- 1: Separate subject from body with blank line (using a text editor - 
    log to see full message, shortlog to see subject) -->
<!-- 2: Limit subject line to 50 characters. If this isn't enough, 
    commits aren't atomic enough -->
<!-- 3: Capitalise the subject line -->
<!-- 4. Do not end the subject line with a full stop -->
<!-- 5. Use the imperative sense in subject line -->
<!-- 6. Wrap body text at 72 characters (so as not to flow into the 
    right margin) -->
<!-- 7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how. Focus on how it 
    used to work, what was wrong with this, why it works now and why
    you decided to solve it the way you did. -->
